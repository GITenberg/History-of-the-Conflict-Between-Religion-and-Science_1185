description: '"The antagonism we witness between Religion and Science is the continuation
  of a struggle that commenced when Christianity began to attain political power.
  Can we exaggerate the importance of a contention in which every thoughtful person
  must take part whether he will or not? In a matter so solemn as that of religion,
  all men, whose temporal interests are not involved in existing institutions, earnestly
  desire to find the truth. What I have sought to do is, to present a clear and impartial
  statement of the views and acts of the two contending parties. In one sense I have
  tried to identify myself with each, so as to comprehend thoroughly their motives;
  but in another and higher sense I have endeavored to stand aloof, and relate with
  impartiality their actions. I therefore trust that those, who may be disposed to
  criticize this book, will bear in mind that its object is not to advocate the views
  and pretensions of either party, but to explain clearly, and without shrinking,
  those of both"--Pr√©face. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).'
